# Accessing Services

<hr>

There are a number of services that k8sdc provides by default.  To confirm a successful installation you can try accessing some of them.

**Note**

The following urls are the default ones.  They also require that your local `/etc/hosts` file contains the correct entries.  See [Hosts File Setup](../../reference/utilities.md#hosts_file_setup) for details.

## Logging 

Using Kibana, Elasticsearch and Fluentd.

[logging.cluster.k8sdc.io](http://logging.cluster.k8sdc.io)

## Job Management 

Using Jenkins.

[jenkins.development.k8sdc.io](http://jenkins.development.k8sdc.io/)

## Artifact Management

Using Artifactory.
