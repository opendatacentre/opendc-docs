# Introduction
___

**Open Datacentre**, also known as **opendc**, provides a set of curated open source [*Products*](reference/product.md) within the productivity, development and infrastructure domains.  These *Products* are integrated and secured *"out of the box"* with management provided by [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io), [Helm](https://helm.sh) and [Ansible](http://kubernetes.io).

## Purpose

**Opendc** attempts to provide an entire set of integrated IT [*Capabilities*](reference/capability.md) that can be stood up rapidly and with little to no cost (dependant on where **opendc** is hosted).  The provided *Capabilities* can be categorised into the following areas.

* Management of a business with productivity [*Products*](reference/product.md).
* Development and hosting of digital content with development and infrastructure *Products*.

The intention is to give small / medium and non-profit organisations the ability to easily stand up an infrastructure that rivals the *Capabilities* of an enterprise, thus freeing them to focus their resources on providing business value.

## Overview

**Opendc** has [*Capabilities*](reference/capability.md) that are realised through [*Solutions*](reference/solution.md).  These *Solutions* are implemented by [*Products*](reference/product.md) with a relevant configuration.  Each *Capability* can potentially have multiple *Solutions*, leaving the choice of which to use up to the end user.
